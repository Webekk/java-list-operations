# Learning Java - Lists

This repository contains a Java program that demonstrates basic operations on `List` data structure using the `ArrayList` class. The program includes examples of adding, removing, retrieving, and sorting elements in a list.

## Features

- Creating a list and adding elements to it
- Accessing elements by index
- Removing elements from a list
- Checking if a list contains a specific element
- Iterating over a list using a for-each loop
- Sorting a list in descending order

## Code Walkthrough

1. **Creating a List:**
   The program starts by creating a `List` using `ArrayList` and adding integers to it.

2. **Adding Elements:**
   It demonstrates adding elements at specific positions using the `add(index, element)` method.

3. **Removing Elements:**
   The program removes an element at a specific index using the `remove(index)` method.

4. **Accessing Elements:**
   You can access an element in the list by its index using the `get(index)` method.

5. **Checking for Element Existence:**
   The program checks if a certain element exists in the list using the `contains(element)` method.

6. **Iterating Over the List:**
   A for-each loop is used to print all the elements in the list.

7. **Sorting the List:**
   The program demonstrates sorting the list in descending order using `Collections.sort()` and `Collections.reverseOrder()`.
